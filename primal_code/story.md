## 1. We didn't pay for the flux capacitor AKA liar, liar, pants on fire

I supported a sales system where sales reps would work up their quotes and then submit for approval and processing. The orders the reps did were "bulk" orders usually over $100K and frequently over $300K so you'd think they would take time to double check the details.

The business model was to list all items on the order at MSRP and have any negotiated discount rolled up in a "sale discount" line with the amount for the discount on the entire sale.

I received a ticket one day that "the system" had failed to copy the discount amount on the sales discount line on one of the quotes to the resulting order.  This was the first and only report we had of this type of system error so I suspected the rep was lying.

Without going into all the details, between the audit trail and timing of the test environment data refresh I was able to prove conclusively that the rep had **left the discount amount at** **zero dollars** on the quote until **after the order had been invoiced**.

He had **changed the quote** **after** **the resulting order had been completed and closed**.  (We should have locked the quotes down once they had been submitted, approved and pushed through but the business said we needed to keep the quotes editable for "reasons".)

The sales rep had just flat out **forgotten to fill in the discount amount** he had agreed upon with the customer and then **tried to blame the system**.

I took all the information to my boss.  He told me to summarize my findings in an email to two levels of rep's hierarchy and himself (my boss) and close the ticket with "No system defect found".  I made sure to keep a backup copy of all my screenshots etc buried in my "CYA" folder.

I can't say that I recall for sure what happened but I don't think he was with the company for too long after that.  Word actually got around pretty quick amongst the reps that blaming their mistakes on "the system" was not going to work.

## 2. Solidworks and a Company's Shared Drive

I'm not sure if this story would qualify as tech support but might as well. Recently I interned at an electronics production company where I was assigned to the engineering department (mechanical design, wiring, jig maintenance, etc.). 

Around the same time I got into the company, a woman about my age (we'll call her Tiffany) also started interning there. Tiffany was a pretty capable and diligent worker and our coworkers there were really fond of her. (like, REALLY fond) 

The story starts a month into our internship when our supervisor, Carl, handed us separate design tasks using Solidworks. This task was put on top of our regular jig and machine maintenance at the production line so we were quite busy that day. 

I got, presumably, one of the easier out of the 2 design tasks. Carl gave us instructions on how he wanted the structures to be and told us of design elements we could use that were already in the company's shared drive for parts that the company readily had.

So the both us went to work on the projects in the morning while still helping out the engineers in the production line. Granted that the projects were fairly simple we were told to have the designs available by tomorrow morning to show to the project manager. 

Around lunchtime I noticed Tiffany had started to take a few available parts from the workshop as reference. At the time I merely thought nothing of it because I knew she was competent enough to do her work and continued with my own work. 

At around 5 my work was nearly done and I was stretching myself when I turned around to see a frustrated Tiffany massaging her head facing her monitor. I decided to initiate some small chat and ask if her work was ok. 

Me: 'You doing okay there?'

Tiff: ' I would be if there weren't so many goddamn parts in this project.' 

Puzzled, I decided to look at her monitor to see how her progress was going. There staring blankly at me in the face was a custom screw cap that was a usual sighting in the company. 

Me: ' What about the parts? '

Tiff: 'I wished Carl just gave us the 3d models for these parts.' 

That's when I realised what she had been doing for the past working day. She had been making the 3d models for each and every part that was going into the project. INCLUDING THE ONES THAT WERE ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE COMPANY DRIVE.

Me: 'He did give them.' 

Tiff:  'What do you mean?' 

Me:  'They're in the company drive.' 

Tiff: 'What company drive?' 

She seemed bewildered when I started to navigate to the company drive on her pc. When I clicked on the file with the 3d models she stared blankly at them for a good minute before putting her face in her hands. 

For her project there were around 15 parts that she could have gotten from the company drive like screws, caps, nozzles, etc. For every minute of the working day she had worked on EVERY SINGLE ONE of them FROM SCRATCH and had barely started on the main structure.

Tiffany then continued her work  with a sullen face (using the available 3d models) while I finished up on my work when it was nearing the end of the shift. Tiffany had no choice but to work overtime to finish her task.

I initially decided to leave on time to meet with some friends but later thought to cancel my plans and also work overtime to help her out. 

Later went out for a late dinner with her and she explained how she had no idea what the company drive was, ignored it and merely continued with work. 

So that's basically the whole story and how I got my first girlfriend.

Sorry for the medium-to-long post. This is my first time posting here.

## 3. A different kind of printer problem

This was around 15 years ago when my department moved into a new building. “New” was a matter of opinion. It happened to be a rather old building but it was nicer than the temporary building we previously occupied. 

We set up our IT office and repair bench with the standard array of monitors, laser printers, tools, bins for parts, you know the drill. 

It was well known that this building had a few HVAC quirks, but nothing terribly uncomfortable. Except our room. It was FREEZING. We all had to wear coats all the time. Maintenance paid several visits to try and figure it out, but the air conditioning in the building was confusing. It was central, mostly, but some rooms could control to some extent. Our room had controls, but no matter what we set, the ghost in the machine decided that our room needed to be at least 10-20 degrees (F) colder than everywhere else. 

Months went by and we more or less got used to it. 

We had this big honkin’ laser printer in our room. It was old, but it could print 11x17 color, so we kept it alive with whatever we had available. On this fateful day, I unplugged it and pulled it away from the wall to work on the duplex attachment in the back and noticed a small box on the wall, no bigger than a deck of cards, hidden behind the printer. It had no markings nor controls, but it had a small grill in the plastic. Whatever. After 15 minutes or so, I noticed that the air coming through the HVAC vents wasn’t cold anymore. I finished up with the printer, plugged it in, rolled it back into place and a test print reminded me that I’m good at my job. 

And the cold air started flowing again. 

If you haven’t yet pieced this puzzle together, I’ll bring you to the punchline. Laser printers, particularly old ones, generate a lot of heat exhaust which is blown out the back of the unit. Right onto that box on the wall. Which turned out to be the room’s HVAC thermometer sensor.

We moved the printer six feet away, against another wall, and within a day our room was back to normal operating temperatures.

## 4. And, a waste of time

So one evening, recently, I get a text from a customer who I had helped before. He basically said he wanted to get a new laptop for his wife but he really knew nothing about computers and knew I did, so he really wanted my help. He informed me that the system she has is only a year old but it is running like garbage and he thinks it needs replaced. He told me that he had a $1,000.00 budget. He said he trusts my recommendation and has the money in hand. He informed me of what she will use the system for etc etc. Now I should let you guys know, that I had prior knowledge of his wife's system as I have worked on it recently. It has a intel i3 with 4gb RAM and a mechanical hard drive.

So anyway, now I did tell him at the time that my recommendation would include at least an i7 CPU, a solid state hard drive as well as a minimum of 16GB RAM. He responds with, "Yes, whatever you suggest, as long as it is better than what she has now and as long as it dont exceed $1,000.00. So I told him to give me a few hours and I would just email him a few links to some systems (On amazon) that I would recommend.

So about an hour later, I find a little bit of time. I sit down and get to work on searching out some systems that would fit his budget and what his wife will be using it for. Of course, this does not take a lot of time. when you know what you are looking for and know how to use the search filters, it goes pretty quick. All in all, after comparing 3 different laptops, I sent him the links in an email in the order that I would recommend each system and included an explanation of why I suggested each one in the order that did.

By this time, it is late and I knew I would not get a reply, so I went on to bed. Well this morning, I wake up, get my day started and around mid morning I get a text from the guy. The text includes a link, to Wal-Mart, and it shows a Laptop. The text reads, "I got your email, thank you. We decided to order this one last night. What do you think?" I asked, "You already ordered it?" He says replies, "Yes" I open the link, look at the system, and could almost not contain my laughter. The system he ordered was the same exact model as the one he had and so of course it had the same exact specs. LOL...It took me a good 10 minutes to reply because I was laughing and then of course I had the confusion, and then of course that turned to anger because again, I had gone out of my way to help someone that was not going to listen to someone who knows what they are talking about.

Now yeah I could have replied called the guy an idiot, could have told him he ordered the same exact system, but I took the high road. I simply replied and said, "Great man, hope it works out for ya guys. Talk to you later."

So I hope you guys find this comical, amusing, educational, etc. Have a great night everyone!

TL;DR; Person asks for help getting an up to date usable laptop to replace their current. They end up ignoring the recommendation by a pro and buys the same model system (Same Specs) they were trying to replace.

## 5. Excelling in Communication

Hi guys, long time reader first time poster.

I've worked as a tech for a small MSP for a few years now and I experience my fair share of Reddit worthy moments. You tend to get a feel for a users technical abilities over the years but sometimes it just hits you like a sack of bricks.

The lovely $adminlady of this particular office spends all day using Microsoft Office, especially Excel. She often has her head in a spreadsheet each day. Today her usual routine was thrown off as she was using a temporary computer assigned to her after leaving her laptop at home. No worries though, I connect through TeamViewer and sign her into OneDrive and Microsoft Office having all her files synced in a matter of seconds. I open Microsoft Word to check that her Office365 has been activated, everything looks happy so I disconnect my TeamViewer and say my goodbyes...

$adminlady: Wait I need to check Excel will open

$me: Oh sure, just open it up then

$adminlady: I can't see the shortcut

$me: Just type it in the start menu and you'll see it there

$adminlady: ... It says Network Discovery is turned Off?

$me: *\*Oh good she has opened file explorer and not the start menu\**

$me: Okay so you'll need to click on the start menu down the bottom left hand corner and type it into the search box there

$adminlady: Oh! The start menu okay.... and I type Excel? 

$me: Yes, Excel,  then you should see the icon appear.

$adminlady: It's asking me to register Excel I dont understand, didn't we just do this?

Surely it can't be that hard, I just signed her into Office365. There shouldn't be any possible issues with her opening Excel, maybe she has an old version on there that isn't working. I fire up my TeamViewer once more and reconnect.

$me: Ahh I see the issue. You'll need to type in E X C E L

Bless her heart, the lovely $adminlady has typed in the letters "xl" and Windows first search result was an .xlsx file named "Register"

$me: Here you go, I'll just pin this shortcut to the taskbar so you don't have to worry about that anymore

$adminlady: Is it definitely registered??? 

$Me: Yes, yes it is definitely registered.. Have a lovely day $adminlady, and please don't forget your laptop tomorrow.

## 6. Network cutting out at 9:00 in the morning.

This was back in the 80's, when offices weren't designed with network cabling in mind, Netware and Banyan Vines were battling it out, and you could still smoke in the office.

I had a user in the office portion of our warehouse (DEFINITELY didn't have cabling in mind when it was built) whose network connection started cutting out between 9 and 9:10 AM, every morning, starting in November. Sometimes it would come back; sometimes it wouldn't....it was really weird. I swapped the NIC with a known good one (mine); my unit stayed connected while the users continued to cut out. I swapped out the CPU; I rebuilt her hard drive and loaded and reloaded drivers downloaded from Compuserve at a million dollars a minute....and no go.

Until one morning I was at her desk, waiting for the network connection to die, when I watched a co-worker walk in (he started later than everyone else at 9) and hang his coat on the coat rack next to the door....and a few moments later, the connection dropped.

I looked at the coat rack, then looked at the floor, and noticed a network cable under one of the legs of the coat rack. I managed to lift the rack just enough to slide the cable out from under the rack, and the connection came back up. It seems the sixth coat on the rack was just enough to pull the cable out of the nearby rack and drop her connection.   


Just to be safe, I replaced her cable, and anchored it to the baseboard with antenna clips. Never had a problem again.

## 7. Government puts tax dollars to good use in high security tech setup

So, I'm the sole IT person for a smallish Environmental Engineering firm. Our company also manages several waste water plants for counties/townships. 

There is one particular plant that uses a SCADA system to control plant equipment/functions. This system uses TCP Modbus to interface between the HMI PC and the PLC. I should note TCP Modbus generally does not implement encryption, or even authentication; as such the actually Modbus decides should generally be on their own network without any direct connection to the internet, and that only contains devices that NEED to be on said network. 

The first time I went to this plant, I was called out for some simple tech support stuff (cant remeber what exactly what). I was told to look over the networking while I was there, and see if all was good. When I got their I noticed that there main router/firewall was the one built into the modem, not ideal, but no biggie. I asked how I should connect my laptop to the network, and was told to connect to the unsecured wifi network. Obviously this was a bit alarming to me, so I asked why they had a completely open network. The response I got was that there was a dog pound next door that needed internet, so the county stuck an outdoor AP to the side of the building and pointed it there, and didnt even have the bright idea to put a password on it. I then set about trying to temporarily hobble together some old routers to at least keep our plant behind a firewall from this network, until I could figure out something more proper. As I was swapping cables around, a gentlemen came into the plant, somewhat frustrating, saying that internet at the airport had gone down. I said, "I'm not sure, were a waste water plant... you should check with your ISP." He then informed me that actually, there was a P2P wifi bridge on the roof that connected the airport to our network. Apparently the county was to cheap to buy them all their own internet, so they through together a way for us all to share one connection, and just hooked it all into the provided cable modem/router... 

I was already horrified, but then when continuing my work, I discovered the SCADA system was on the SAME NETWORK that all 3 entities were sharing. Let me remind you, the Modbus used implement NO authentication or encryption, you just sent commands to it over TCP/IP and it executed them. So any dipshit with a laptop that was close enough to connect to the UNSECURED long range outdoor AP could theoretically connect up and start sending it commands. Obviously they wont know what address goes to what equipment, but if you just say, turn on all the coil registers(used to control relays) you would most definitly cause something really really bad to happen.

I eventually was able to sort it out and do proper networking, but still.

Oh, also the scada HMI PC was running XP, 5 years after its EOL...

## 8. People expect to be able to connect to their home WiFi from anywhere

I work for a decent size WISP, obviously I am Tech Support.

A customer of ours calls us and chews me out about how she hasn't had internet all week and we are a terrible company. I just take it and let her steam out, all the while I bring up her billing and connect to her router to see what the issue is.

She stops chewing me out, apologizes and we move on. I can see she has a Ring Doorbell and few IP cameras and nothing else connected. I walk her through the process of connecting her phone to the WiFi. She can't see the SSID though, so I ask her to power cycle her router. She then tells me "oh I can't right now, I'm in Dallas seeing some friends. I'll be home tonight." At this point I think I misunderstood her problem and shouldn't have zoned out while she ranted for 5 minutes. So I ask "is your problem that you can't connect your phone to the WiFi or that you can't connect to a your Ring?" She says "no, my problem is that I can't connect to my home WiFi right now. It always cuts out at the end of my driveway and can never connect to again until I'm home. I need you to come replace that router so it will work."

The remainder of that phone call was me trying to explain to her that NO WiFi router ever made at this point and time can or will connect to someone over 75 miles away.

## 9. Sweet old lady needs help setting up DSL

This story is a bit cuter than the typical fare on this subreddit, but it still makes me smile to this day.

This was 18 years ago. I was 20 and 2 weeks into my first tech support role for the local DSL ISP.  1 hour of training then they put us on the phones.  Job was pretty straightforward, with all the stress and anxiety of dealing with the general public using a service that degrades in the rain.  Each CRT had a list of customers that should be immediately transfered to management (level 3) due to their frequent hyperspecific death threats against top executives of the company. 

Anyway, onto this cute caller.  We shipped out a generic self install kit to all new customers.  It had a phone line filter, modem, cables, cd with drivers and a few information packets.  This customer claims their kit spelled their name wrong.  These kits were not personalized in any way, so I was initally confused.  

I patiently asked where her name was printed.  She replied, "It's on the screen, right at the top, it says E-U-L-A and my name is E-L-L-A"

I laughed a bit, explained to Ella what an End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is.  Then I took my sweet ass time walking this kind old lady through the rest of her DSL setup.

She eventually kinda laughed along with me.  I was pretty proud of my newbie self for getting that one.

## 10. Simulated trouble shooting, GI style OR how my troops learned to live with solar fade

I was a platoon leader in a US Army signal company during Desert Storm. We used tropospheric scatter microwave communication equipment to create digital trunks between sites (quite a mouthful, ain't it).  My company was the only company in theater that had this equipment so rather than stay together, like most signal companies, once we hit the sand we scattered like roaches all over the desert.

As signal tends to go at that level, you work like hell for about two days to get everything set up, link working, camo in place etc.  After that it's weeks of sitting around keeping the shot in which really means trying not to be bored to death and reacting to any alarms that occur.

I was visiting one team.  It was getting late in the afternoon and they were sitting around in the tent playing cards.  All of a sudden the alarm on the remote monitoring box went off and the light went from green to red meaning the signal lock was gone. 

# The shot was down.  

One of the guys hit a switch to kill the alarm. The light stayed red and they just kept playing cards.  I trusted all my team chiefs and didn't say a thing.  I waited to see how this played out.  

Less than a minute later the ops sergeant from the site CP called with instructions to try this and that.  Team chief was like "Sure thing.  We'll call you back in a few."  They played a few more hands.  Team chief called back to CP and told the ops sergeant that didn't work.  Ops sergeant gives more instructions.  "Sure thing".  Play more cards. Call back and say it's still down.  Rinse and repeat a few more times.

I finally ask the team chief what's up.  He says "Go outside, stand directly behind the antennas and look in the direction they are pointing." I gave him a slightly confused look.  He said "Trust me LT, you'll figure it out."

I came back after doing as he suggested and the following dialogue ensued. (TC=Team Chief)

Me: The antenna dish is pointing directly into the setting sun.

TC: Exactly. Twenty minutes ago the shot started to degrade. Ten minutes ago it failed.  Ten minutes from now it will start to come back and another ten after that it will be back at full strength.

Me: What was that whole thing with the ops sergeant.

TC: We actually tried stuff the first few days this started happening. Then we got sergeant Mac involved and explained what was happening.  Sergeant Mac said that there wasn't anything we could do.  The sun is washing out the shot as it sets every day and we'd either have to live with it for a couple of weeks until the sun shifted further north as it sets or they would have to reconfigure the network to take this shot out.

(*SGT Mac was was a grizzled old E-7 who was a technical guru on the equipment.  No one, not even tech reps from the defense contractor who designed the stuff, knew more than he did about our equipment*).

Me: I get it.  The sun is overloading the receiver.  No amount of troubleshooting will fix it.  But what was with him giving you stuff to do and you ignoring it?

TC:  The afternoon OIC (officer in charge) is a real poindexter and expects us to try all the "by the book" troubleshooting possible despite the fact that we know why this is happening and that there isn't anything we can do about it.  He wants to be able to report to his boss that "all possible steps were taken to resolve the issue."  The ops sergeant and I worked out that he would call and we would pretend we tried.

Me: You better hope the OIC doesn't decide to do an onsite inspection while you guys are faking the troubleshooting.  

TC: No worries LT.  He tried that a couple of times early on.  The ops sergeant called and lets us know the OIC was on his way.  The CP is way over on the other side of the compound and we are out there messing with the equipment before the OIC can even see our site.

I was back a couple of weeks later and the daily outage went away as quickly as it had started just like sergeant Mac had predicted.

## 11. But it is just too much work, I will just buy a new one.

Hello everybody it has been a while since I have posted but I have another story for you. I may also be posting another in the next few days. 

So, a few days ago I was contacted by a usual customer, as I have said in other posts, I am a local computer technician and I’m pretty well known for helping people in my town. A few days ago, an elderly gentleman who I have worked with before contacted me telling me that he has several Wi-Fi devices in his home and suddenly they work for a few minutes and then they stop working. So, I did a remote session with him check some things out had him down to load a Wi-Fi analyzer on his phone, and as it turned out, as I suspected, he was having some Wi-Fi interference as he lived in a small apartment complex and there were multiple other Wi-Fi hot spots around and being broadcast, and on the same channel he was on.

So, at this point I told him we needed to log into the router can change the Wi-Fi Channel to a channel that was not being used. From the read out of the Wi-Fi analyzer we found that there were a few channels available. He was confused and asked me what I meant by this and I explain to him that basically his WIFI was on the same channel as a couple other WIFI’s and it was causing interference. I told him I will go into the router change his channel to a less congested channel and he should be good to go.

Well, this apparently confused him a great deal because he just said well that sounds like too much work to go through and if my router is no good, I will just buy a new one. I explain to him, or tried to explain to him rather, that there was nothing wrong with his router that it was functioning fine but it was just on the same channel as other routers causing a conflict with frequencies. He wanted nothing to do with what I was explaining to him, LOL, he insisted that there was no need for me to go in and change the channel as he continued to say it was too much work. I continue to tell him that it will literally take me less than 30 seconds to make the change and he will be good to go. He continually declined and said that he would just go down to Best Buy and buy a new router. He was insistent that this would resolve this issue and all I could do was say OK, after this I ended the call.

Well, here we are this morning I get a call from the same guy telling me that he thinks that his Internet service provider is having issues. Not even thinking back to the router incident, I asked him why he believes his Internet service is having issues. He proceeds to explain, that he bought a new router, hooked everything up, and he is still having the same issue. At this point I was frustrated, I explained to him that there is nothing wrong with his Internet, just like there is nothing wrong with his router, the old one or the new one, I explained to him that the issue is a channel conflict that would be easily resolved if he would just let me log in and change the channel, again ensuring him that it is not a lot of hard work and that it will take less than a minute. So, he said, “so you are telling me that I spent money for nothing on this new router?” I replied, “yes, I told you the other day that the router was not the issue.” Additionally, I let him know that I have been doing this for many years and I know what I’m talking about. 

So just to shorten up the story here he agreed to let me give it a shot, he wanted to take the new router back so Hey hook up the old one and I went in change the channel Hey what do you know, all of his devices started working at work connected very solid.

I really just don’t understand, this day and age, people refuse to listen to the people that know what they are doing, it is just unreal to me.

TL;DR – customer thought that it was too much work for me to go in and change his Wi-Fi channel so decided to buy a new router instead which did not fix the problem, then eventually let me just change the channel which did fix the problem.

## 12. Odd network behavior...but is it?

Ok this was back in the 90's, maybe right around Win95B or so.

Had a customer that I just built a few PCs for, a bunch of really nice guys that ran a legal services group.  Installed about half a dozen PCs for them.  Maybe a week or two later, one of them won't connect to the network.  So I drop by to see what's what.

Log on to the PC and sure enough, no net.  The PC was in a hutch in the desk, back when that was the fashion.  So I slide the PC out onto the floor in front of the desk and pop the case off.  Unplug the net card and plug it back in.  Give it a little wiggle to assure good connection.  It works.  No big deal, loose card.  Put the cover back on and push it back in the hutch.  Network halts.

I go through this routine maybe 3 times.  Out of hutch, net.  Back in hutch, no net.  I'm suspecting maybe the hutch is torqueing the network jack maybe.

On the last trip out I decide to pull the PC all the way out, disconnect everything, and take it home with me.  That's when I notice the problem.

When I was pulling the PC out of the hutch and sitting on the floor, I wasn't paying attention to the case.  I had somehow missed that the customer had decorated one entire side of the metal case cover in refrigerator magnets.

## 13. The clock’s wrong!

Part of my work is for a small tertiary education institution in Sydney, Australia. 

About 10 years ago I was tasked with setting up a new server for their instance of a popular open source learning management system, which we shall call OS-LMS for short. The new server was, like the old one, a Linux machine running the usual LAMP stack. Given that the Aus academic year runs within each calendar year, I was setting up the machine in late spring (November) so that it would be ready for use in the new year.

Now this institution’s use of OS-LMS includes online submission of assignments in PDF form. Deadlines were always 11:55 pm Sydney time, and the mantra when talking to students was that the deadline was measured using “server time”, irrespective of their individual computer time. To assist with this we had a plug-in that displayed server time on every page on the web interface.

In Sydney, Daylight Saving (Summer Time) is in effect from the first Sunday in October until the first Sunday in April, so when I set up and tested the server it was Summer Time. Everything went well, the new server was working smoothly, and we migrated to it without a hitch.

Then April rolls around. Daylight Saving ends. Clocks are reset. Computers do the NTP thing and adjust their clocks to Standard Time.

Then a colleague tells me, “The Server Clock display on OS-LMS is still on Summer Time!”.

Crap!

So I start digging. Server is set to the correct time zone, and has done the NTP thing. So why is the Server Clock widget still showing Summer Time.

Except that it isn’t!

The php.ini file has its own time zone setting, doesn’t it! And that version of PHP had a default value of “Antarctica/Macquarie”. Australia Eastern Standard Time is UTC +10. Antarctica/Macquarie is UTC +11. When I set up the web server, it was Summer Time, so I didn’t notice the time zone error.

Once I had set the PHP time zone to its correct value (Australia/Sydney), I moaned on Fakebook, “Who on earth runs web servers in Antarctica?”

A very learned friend replied, “The penguins, and they’re running Linux!”

Edit:
1) thanks for all the awards! I’m very flattered!
2) further note on the default time zone: I suspect that the choice of default is based on the lack of population living in that time zone. That would, in theory, mean you’re more likely to notice and investigate. In my case, the complicating factor was Daylight Saving/Summer Time.

## 14. The 3 signs of water damage

Working as a repair tech at a phone/tablet/computer repair shop in a mall has all the quirks of retail and tech support jobs. But I like the small family owned shop and get to work alone most days without being bothered by management or coworkers. It’s simple. Except sometimes customers can be frustrating. 

The following story is true, just happened yesterday. All names of individuals and companies have been omitted. 

Last week I sold a refurbished phone to a nice guy for his son who “can’t seem to keep a phone more than a year.” Less than a week later the son, in his mid 20s, comes in to the shop to complain that one morning he woke up and his phone just wouldn’t turn on. So he took the phone to *our direct competitor big chain phone repair store* and they told him the phone was non repairable and he should just get a new phone. So he shows up to the store it was purchased at to return it or replace it under our warranty. I ask if it was damaged, dropped or wet. “No, definitely not. It just quit working all of a sudden for no reason. It’s a bad phone” 

I ask him to let me open it and see if it can be repaired. He says he needs to go out to another store and would be back in about 15 min. When I open the device up there is literally a puddle of water in it. At this point I put it together. This guy dropped his phone in some liquid, took it to another repair store, they told him it was toast, so he tries to return it thinking he can pull a fast one on my little family owned shop. 

When he comes back, we had this satisfying exchange: (me=me.  Cx=customer)

Me: when I opened up your phone I noticed some water damage that is likely the culprit for the device failure. 
Cx: what!? I haven’t even had the phone for a week! I didn’t get it wet. 
Me: well, there are 3 ways to identify liquid damage. First there is a little white sticker inside the device that turns red when exposed to water. Second, many of the internal metal components rust easily and others stain easily when exposed to liquids. Third, when you open the device, liquid literally drips out. Your phone had a puddle in it. Unfortunately our warranty does not cover water damage. 

Cx: Ok, well I need a phone, can you fix it? 
Me: we can send it out for board level repair but that can take a while and may exceed the replacement value of the phone. I would only suggest attempting repair if the data is really important and not backed up anywhere. We do have other refurbished phones for sale, including another of the exact same model. 

Feeling for this guy I even offer a small discount and help him get it set up. We get to the setup stage where he needs to log into a cloud account and some other customers come in. He steps aside and tries to log in. Just as I’m checking the other customer out he barges in and shoved the phone in my face exclaiming “what the hell is this!” A pop up message says something about entering the password wrong too many times and being locked out for 14 days. I say “seems like you entered your password wrong too many times and are locked out. You could try getting in touch with the company and see if they’ll unlock the account and phone for you but I can’t do anything about that. 

Cx: what the actual fuck! This is bullshit, you sold me 2 broken phones!
Me: no sir, I sold you two phones that you broke. If you’d like I have another phone of the exact same model for sale right here. I can even give you a slight discount for being a frequent customer. 
Cx: are you shitting me! No! I want this phone I just bought to work! 
Me: well, I’d suggest calling the company or getting in touch with them online. You could also wait the 2 week lockout period and try your password again. 
Cx: how am I supposed to do call the company without a working phone? 
Me: there’s a public library about 10 minutes away. I can get you the address...

The guy storms out of the shop cussing.

## 15. Sure I'll take the desktop away

In 2019 we've 'upgraded' all our desktops by replacing 7 or 8 year old fat clients with chromeboxes. It's worked pretty well. The screens and pehipherals were still fine, so we only replaced the actual machines.  In addition to these fixed setups there's a lot of chromebooks in use on each department. They were rolled out in 2019 as well and are pretty much identical to the desktops.

This week we got a ticked about a desktop. The complaint was:

"This desktop is too old, we can't do anything with it anymore. Everything that we need to do works so much better on the chromebooks. Please remove this old machine."

Which frankly, we did. No drama, no argument. It's really just a little funny that these devices, being functionally identical to the chromebooks are considered old and useless.

## 16. What Year is it!!!

While I’m primarily engineering new solutions, occasionally I need to help our maintenance with some tasks that they aren’t currently equipped/trained to do.  

In this particular instance, a large machine(roughly 80ft long) had an HMI(Human Machine Interface) computer die.  This computer was roughly 15 years old at this point so it was not really a surprise, but of course it died at a time we needed it to process some parts that absolutely needed to ship ASAP.  Maintenance had already looked at it and had gone through the levels of bureaucracy needed to call me in for help (I’m always willing to help keep the machines that pay for me running, but just asking me would be too easy).  

I do want to stress at this point that while the head of Maintenance and I are definitely not best pals, I have nothing but respect for the personnel in that department.  The Maintenance guy ( We’ll just call him Bob) and I get the computers swapped out and start setting up the new one.  The new computer had never been activated or setup, as we use these for a number of purposes and buying and pre setting them up would be way too expensive.  Apparently have a machine bill out at $xxx per hour down instead is a cost savings, but hey I’m just a dumb engineer and not an accountant.  This brand new(10 year on a shelf) computer has never even been booted up before so windows(xp, this was 3 years ago) was never activated.  This is when Bob and I decide to do a hard drive swap with the old system as the 2 computers were nearly identical.  This ended up being quite the process helped by the fact that upper management feels that standing there and watching us work until they got bored was going to help the process out.  The shop manager specifically asked me how late I would stay to fix it.  He couldn’t wrap his head around my answer of “until it’s fixed, don’t worry” and asked at least 3 times how late I would stay to fix it.  He never did get a different answer (I am salary, but the 2 or 3 times a year I need to stay late to save the day is fine with me, I make sure they know what I’ve done).  

Fast forward to about half an hour after quitting time for me, and we have it all buttoned up, but the HMI software (Indusoft, which is a steaming pile of crap) is giving the strangest license error.  We reboot and this time it works, reboot again and it’s broken (someone has figured out this issue at this point I’m sure).  Well after about an hour of dicking around Bob says “hey, why is the date 1900m didn’t we already set the clock in BIOS?”.  Well long story short it turns out that sitting on a shelf for a decade will kill a bios battery and in this case the date was set to something somewhat random (also no date not set boot error).  Well apparently, our Indusoft license doesn’t expire in the future, but also doesn’t exist in the past.  We put a very large note on the screen saying not to shut the machine off until a new battery could arrive and that, was the end of that.  


TLDR: Bios battery go brrrrr

## 17. Boss learns expensive lesson

Hello fellow subs. This may not be a typical r/TalesFromTechSupport post, but this just seemed the most appropriate place for the story.

It's the year 1996 and our 5-person company was using PCs that ranged from 8088's (running DOS3.3) to 386's (running Windoze 3.11, first OS we had that could be networked, ok so we had only the one PC with W3.11, but we were ready to network!).  I get to work one morning and there is a box sitting at my station with a brand new Intel 486/66 full tower PC from the Blue Shirts &amp; Nerd Platoon store with a note from my boss to get the machine setup for use. Aside from the obvious removal of all the preloaded crapware, I would need to install a CD-RW drive, a second physical hard drive, network card and all of our company software. No problem, not my first rodeo. I unbox the PC and slice open the anti-tamper, warranty voiding security tape fastening the case to the rear panel. Remove the screws holding the case and slide the enclosure off. I had to replace the IDE cables going to the CD-ROM and HD (each was a single device cable) so I could connect both HD's and both CD's on the Primary and Slave ISE bus respectively. I also had to make (yes, make) a couple molex power T-adapters for the hard drives. Finally install an ISA NIC for ethernet.

So I've got everything installed, cables are plugged in and mounting screws are all tight. I decide to power up the system with the case off just to make sure everything's working before I button it up and commission it into service. I plug everything in, monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. and power up the PC. Everything looks great, boots up fast and all the drives are working. Our company softwares get installed and I'm getting ready to take an early celebratory lunch when the Boss looks over my shoulder into the exposed motherboard cavity, pulls out a pencil and places the eraser squarely between the fan blades of the CPU and tells me the fan couldn't possibly be that necessary. Before he even has finished his sentence (even before my brain could grasp what I was seeing), the monitor goes blank, the power supply fan shut down, the LED light in the case and the one on the motherboard all went dark. I yanked out the power cable but it was too late, the magic smoke had been released, we could already smell the aroma of cooked silicon wafer. I looked at the Boss and just nodded my head in stunned disbelief to answer his question.

Now he tells me to remove all of our stuff, button up the case and re-box it so he can return it for a replacement. Our company softwares are already installed, so I yank out their HD, plug it in to another PC's IDE port and proceed to manually delete the files and folders that I just installed. Before the end of day I've finished and he takes the system back to BS&amp;NP store. The next morning there is another box with a brand new Intel 486/66 at my station. I asked Boss how it went and he grumbled as he gestured me to get to work on the new-NEW computer. Later that day, I learned from our A/P gal that he had spent the remainder of the previous day trying to talk BS-NP store into accepting the damaged PC. He even pointed out that he had purchased their premier extended warranty plan, but to no avail.  I figured the first thing they did was open the box and discover the anti-tamper warranty voiding tape had been cut and promptly refused to grant the replacement. All told it cost more than $3900USD (plus my hourly) to discover that CPU fans are in there for a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

I understand some of the skepticism. I'm just relaying what happened folks. But to answer some questions...

Ok, the year may have been 1997 or even '98 and the CPU I think was the Cyrix 6x86, my boss wasn't exactly loose with his purse strings .

I do remember it having Win95 (without USB).

I'll never forget the smell of that toasted CPU.

Opening the cardboard box and removing a PC where all I had to do what plug it in was like Christmas morning. Up to then, all the PC's I had ever commissioned, I had built from scratch.

The molex T-adapter I created for that PC was moved to the replacement PC as well as both IDE cables. I still had to install the CD-RW and HD.

It was a CD-RW. Used this PC (the replacement, obviously) to burn our product's installation software for distribution.

After this "incident" every new PC he brought in, he would have me install a big beefy heatsink and fan. 

As for MY memory...They say memory is the second thing to go....I don't remember the first.

## 18. My Desktop != Your Desktop

So this just happened like a minute ago. One of the team leads in my department was having trouble getting something to work in Excel and pinged me for help. I asked if she could email me the spreadsheet so I could take a look myself, and she sends me a link instead...to the spreadsheet on her desktop. As in, her C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\ desktop. I began rubbing my temples because I knew this particular person well enough to know that a simple explanation would not be heard, processed, and acted on. But I had to try anyway. I responded explaining that I can't access files stored on her hard drive, and that she needs to send it to me as an attachment. She responds by saying "It's on the desktop, if the link won't work just open it." I again explain that her desktop and my desktop are not the same thing, and that I am no more able to open items on her desktop than she is of opening things on mine. She responds (somehow arguing with the guy that she wants help from...if I'm so incompetent why are you asking me for help?) that she's opened the recycle bin. And I have a recycle bin. Therefore since we both have recycle bins, I should be able to open things on her desktop.

This is the point where I dial back the professionalism and let my tenure absorb the hit if she pitches a fit. I say excuse me, and get up, then turn on the kitchen faucet. I work from home and I know from prior experience that it's audible from my home office. I sit back down at my desk and say "I've just turned my kitchen faucet on. Do you have any water in your sink?" The silence lasted a good 10 seconds, and I swear I could almost hear the hamster wheel in her head straining. And she finally says, quietly and clearly trying to sound as neutral and unflustered as possible, "OK that makes sense, I'll send it over as an attachment."

## 19. Latest Version Is Not Your Current Version

First of all, Enligsh is not my native langauge, so please pardon my grammar mistakes.

I'm a software developer, making App in a company for Customs. Our App requires \[System\]12 to run. The latest \[System\] version is 14, so most users run our App without any problem.

Then some User contacted us, reporting the app cannot run on his latest device. It crashes as soon as he opens the app. Our help desk went through the regular troubleshoot: re-install app, restart device and so on, and no, User still can't run App.

So the helpless help desk tranferred to me, I contacted User, went him through the troubleshoot process again, and all failed. So I asked him to confirm the system version. He said it's \[System\] 14. To emphasize this, he sent me a screenshot showing the version.

Then I found something different, and the difference may be the root of problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Sir, your screenshot is your device's update page, the version showing here is the version you are goning to update, not your current version.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: So where can I find my current version ?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It's in Settings, click General, the click About. It's in there.

&amp;#x200B;

Several minutes later, another screenshot was sent to me. It showed the current system version. It's \[System\] 10.

&gt;Me: Sir, your device is too old to run our App, please update your system.

Problem solved.

## 20. User wanted to use the webcam on their desktop to conduct a meeting off-campus

This user has a desktop in their office with an attached webcam, and access to a laptop that their department generally uses to remote into their desktops if needed.  The user had an off-campus meeting, and planned to take the laptop and remote into their desktop PC; cool.

The user was confused, however, because they wanted to use a camera during the meeting, and they were unsure about how they would be able to access the webcam on their desktop PC to conduct the meeting - a meeting in a location physically blocks away from the actual camera.  Being able to use their desktop PC while on the laptop had somehow translated to being able to have the camera function remotely as well, even if they weren't sure how to make it happen.  It took an extra step or two of clarification before I sieved out what they actually wanted from the illogic of what they were asking for.

Fortunately the laptop had a camera, and after getting the user signed into O365/Teams, I was able to convince them that it was a fully functional computer all on its own, no remoting necessary.  

The meeting was presumably a success.

EDIT: Just for clarification, the user needed video at the remote location and had no intention of taking the camera with.  Yes, it is illogical to the point of nonsense, but my supposition is that the paradigm of a remote desktop, where the resources of the office PC are available remotely, was so strong that the logistics of capturing video in that way never occurred.

## 21. This is why IT always gets called to help.

I'm a sys admin and this is the email I got first thing yesterday morning from maintenance that was telling me the lawn mower wouldn't start... 

Ya see, a few weeks ago I got an email from building maintenance that said "the carpet cleaner isn't working" and my first thought was "and this is my problem why?" but we always try and keep that department happy and it was a slow day so I decided to reply and see what was up. 

They told me water was leaking out of it anytime they turned it on. It being a slow day, I decided to go over and see what, if anything, I could do about this.

now most of the mid to late 30's and older of us tech support people grew up and aren't afraid to rip covers off things and peer "under the hood" as it were. Same thing here. Quick look, removed some screws, popped the cover off and found the offending part.  We were able to get the part off, put some silicone on the leaking portion, waited a bit for the silicone to set, slapped it all back together and it worked "better than before". 

We both went a long our merry way and they even brought me donuts the next day.

Now anytime some random machine has an issue, they'll call one of us "to take a look" because we "seem to be able to fix anything!!!"

The lawn mower was out of oil so as soon as I added some...it fired right up. 

The good, I fixed it and saved the company money.

The bad, next time some random machine breaks...they'll call one of us lol

## 22. We did warn you...

I work as tier 2 support, on site at a mine.  They have a database program they use to conduct hearing tests and store all the results for all employees.  The program is really old... like somewhere early 2000's, and is no longer supported or anything.  The email address for support even bounces back.

Well about 6 months ago we did a security audit and this program was a problem, as it has been for awhile.  The employee who enters data is in HR and keeps the username and password on a sticky note at her desk.  No option for additional users, or lockout settings or anything.  The database is encrypted too.  So we tell the mine manager (again) that this software is a problem and needs to be upgraded.  After the long list of issues is explained, his only question is, how much will it cost?  And of course, its not approved, so we keep limping along.

Fast forward 6 months, and HR employee quits.  The mine manager comes to my office and wants us to cut off her access to everything as soon as possible.  Then he asks about the database... Well HR employee changed the password before she left, and now its locked out and encrypted.

Bye bye, database.

## 23. How we found a bug

As previously mentioned, senior tech support for the fruit-based enterprise. It's been a long time since I had anything relevant to say here, there's been a lot of grinding and a lot of boring issues not worthy of coming here. This, however, is the story of how my team found a bug.

A couple of months ago, we started getting the odd call about customers whose Calendar app on their phone/tablet would crash whenever they tried to edit the time on an event, new or previously added.

After following the normal troubleshooting guidelines, we'd hit a dead end because the issue happened after factory resetting the device. We escalated, we collected logs and waited for a response.

Something curious I noticed was that, the customer was able to change day/time within January but, as soon as he tapped Feb 1st, the app crashed.

What started to happen come February? An influx of calls all related to the same thing, with the aggravating factor that the issue had spread to the Reminders app and the Clock app, whenever trying to set an alarm. We collected logs and offered a generic "We're looking into it" response.

A couple of weeks later, a colleague of mine says on our team chat:
"This is my third straight call about the Calendar app crashing, and they are all islanders!" The country I provide support to has 2 island groups and she was referring to one of the island groups. 

"Huh... Interesting...", I thought. I checked the 2 cases I had that day and sure enough, both were from the same island group. 

I told the chat: "Guys, ask the customers with the Calendar app issue where they're based, we may be onto something." 

After a few more confirmations that everybody was in that island group, I called back one of my customers. 

- "Hi there! Sorry to call you back unannounced, but I want to try something out with you." 

You see, this island group is an hour behind the rest of the country. So, I asked the customer to set his timezone to mainland time... And it worked! He could create events and set alarms and reminders again. 
So, to avoid confusion, I looked on Wikipedia for another country that uses the same timezone (there's only one) and asked to change the timezone to that country. Lo and behold, it worked just fine! The issue is specific to the timezone set in that island group. 

So I promptly told all my customers of this and told the team that this will fix the issue, which it did for everybody. 

I then told our Engineering staff who promptly replied: "That's great, but send logs." 

All of my customers found it hilarious that such a well-known OS would have a bug that just impacted them and didn't mind changing and waiting for an update that fixed the issue, which it still hasn't been. 

TL;DR: A timezone bug impeded customers from setting the time on several apps. Out of sheer coincidence we narrowed down the issue to a specific island group. Changing the timezone to a different country that uses the same time resolved it.

## 24. “Computer is full, please come free up some space”

I worked tech support from 1987 full time through to the early 2000’s, and a few more part time positions after that. I’ve seen a lot of dumb stuff. One that springs to mind was around 10 years ago, working for a government help desk here in New Zealand. I was on 2nd/3rd level support, so I tried to fix things over the phone but occasionally I’d have to wander over to eyeball the issues up close.

One day I get this call, a woman who says her computer is full. I check her network share, it’s got bugger all data on it, some 90% free of her 1Gb allocated, so I call her. She’s pretty frantic that she can’t save any more documents. I’m wrecking my brain what might be the problem, so I tell her I’ll be right up.

I get there - and keep in mind she’s in an open office with three colleagues around her who haven’t helped her at all - and I instantly see that her *desktop* is full. Of icons. Word icons, excel icons. But not a single folder.

Turns out, after working with computers for what must have been at least a decade, she’d never come across the concept of folders/subdirectories. Once she eventually filled the desktop, she wasn’t sure where to put new icons, and that’s where I got the call.

I fixed it by increasing the resolution of her monitor.

Let me know if you want more stories. I’ve got lots.

Edit: A few people are asking about my solution - I'd hoped my cynicism and sarcasm from working in support for that long would have been self-apparent, but apparently not. My immediate solution was to increase the resolution, and briefly show her how folders worked. The long term solution was to make sure she got herself onto a "windows for beginners" course.

Edit 2: another story in the comments.

## 25. Click and Drag? How do I do that

I'm a legal secretary. 

My firm decided to implement this new system, its basically a complete database for client info and produces documents automatically, but we decided to get it set up before all the bugs had been worked out and so many things are just not right with it, this was about 3 years ago and we're still struggling with it.  Most of us have figured out how to use it, at least for the basics but there are others that are completely hopeless

One of my fee earners is the worst for dealing with this new system, the system is designed so that all of the information is available so that if anyone needs to cover it shouldn't require looking through all the physical files.  However, this fee earner NEVER saves anything into the system unless its done automatically, she only ever saves to her desktop.  If you try and say you need to be doing this and this she always responds with how do i do that, I have explained the same thing to her over and over and over again, my colleague went to her house and spent an entire afternoon teaching her how to use the system and nothing sinks in.  This wouldn't really be a problem but we've gone paperlight due to Covid and god help you if you need to do anything on her files, she's always worked from home anyway.

The one thing that keeps cropping up is ID, I have explained about 3 or 4 times where she needs to go to upload ID documents.  Yesterday I got her to the right screen and told her 'Now you have to click and drag the documents from your email into that area and thats it', her response to that of course is 'How do I do that?'  How do you explain how to click and drag something from one window to another to someone like this, this isn't even a problem with the new system, its basic.  I tried to explain how but my next email from her was 'Hey can you upload this ID for me'   Why ask me how to do something if you're just going to ask me to do it for you

My other fee earner was also pretty clueless about the new system and I'd spend a lot of time directing him to the right place but he at least has tried to learn how to use it, he'll save things to the system now that we've gone paperlight, and he's older than her.  Like I understand some people are pretty clueless when it comes to computers I do get that but we cannot do our job without computers so i don't understand how you can be THAT clueless
