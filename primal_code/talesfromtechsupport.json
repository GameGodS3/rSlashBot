Carl gave us instructions on how he wanted the structures to be and told us of design elements we could use that were already in the company's shared drive for parts that the company readily had.\n\nSo the both us went to work on the projects in the morning while still helping out the engineers in the production line. Granted that the projects were fairly simple we were told to have the designs available by tomorrow morning to show to the project manager. \n\nAround lunchtime I noticed Tiffany had started to take a few available parts from the workshop as reference.

He basically said he wanted to get a new laptop for his wife but he really knew nothing about computers and knew I did, so he really wanted my help. He informed me that the system she has is only a year old but it is running like garbage and he thinks it needs replaced. He told me that he had a $1,000.00 budget. He said he trusts my recommendation and has the money in hand. He informed me of what she will use the system for etc etc. Now I should let you guys know, that I had prior knowledge of his wife's system as I have worked on it recently. It has a intel i3 with 4gb RAM and a mechanical hard drive.\n\nSo anyway, now I did tell him at the time that my recommendation would include at least an i7 CPU, a solid state hard drive as well as a minimum of 16GB RAM. He responds with, \"Yes, whatever you suggest, as long as it is better than what she has now and as long as it dont exceed $1,000.00. So I told him to give me a few hours and I would just email him a few links to some systems (On amazon) that I would recommend.\n\nSo about an hour later, I find a little bit of time. I sit down and get to work on searching out some systems that would fit his budget and what his wife will be using it for. Of course, this does not take a lot of time. when you know what you are looking for and know how to use the search filters, it goes pretty quick. All in all, after comparing 3 different laptops, I sent him the links in an email in the order that I would recommend each system and included an explanation of why I suggested each one in the order that did.\n\nBy this time, it is late and I knew I would not get a reply, so I went on to bed. Well this morning, I wake up, get my day started and around mid morning I get a text from the guy. The text includes a link, to Wal-Mart, and it shows a Laptop. The text reads, \"I got your email, thank you. We decided to order this one last night. What do you think?\" I asked, \"You already ordered it?\" He says replies, \"Yes\" I open the link, look at the system, and could almost not contain my laughter. The system he ordered was the same exact model as the one he had and so of course it had the same exact specs. LOL...It took me a good 10 minutes to reply because I was laughing and then of course I had the confusion, and then of course that turned to anger because again, I had gone out of my way to help someone that was not going to listen to someone who knows what they are talking about.\n\nNow yeah I could have replied called the guy an idiot, could have told him he ordered the same exact system, but I took the high road. I simply replied and said, \"Great man, hope it works out for ya guys. Talk to you later.\"\n\nSo I hope you guys find this comical, amusing, educational, etc. Have a great night everyone!\n\nTL;DR; Person asks for help getting an up to date usable laptop to replace their current.

He said \"Trust me LT, you'll figure it out.\"\n\nI came back after doing as he suggested and the following dialogue ensued.

Ten minutes from now it will start to come back and another ten after that it will be back at full strength.\n\nMe: What was that whole thing with the ops sergeant.\n\nTC: We actually tried stuff the first few days this started happening. Then we got sergeant Mac involved and explained what was happening.  Sergeant Mac said that there wasn't anything we could do.  The sun is washing out the shot as it sets every day and we'd either have to live with it for a couple of weeks until the sun shifted further north as it sets or they would have to reconfigure the network to take this shot out.\n\n(*SGT Mac was was a grizzled old E-7 who was a technical guru on the equipment.

But what was with him giving you stuff to do and you ignoring it?\n\nTC:  The afternoon OIC (officer in charge) is a real poindexter and expects us to try all the \"by the book\" troubleshooting possible despite the fact that we know why this is happening and that there isn't anything we can do about it.  He wants to be able to report to his boss that \"all possible steps were taken to resolve the issue.\"  The ops sergeant and I worked out that he would call and we would pretend we tried.\n\nMe: You better hope the OIC doesn't decide to do an onsite inspection while you guys are faking the troubleshooting.  \n\nTC: No worries LT.

I may also be posting another in the next few days. \n\nSo, a few days ago I was contacted by a usual customer, as I have said in other posts, I am a local computer technician and I\u2019m pretty well known for helping people in my town. A few days ago, an elderly gentleman who I have worked with before contacted me telling me that he has several Wi-Fi devices in his home and suddenly they work for a few minutes and then they stop working. So, I did a remote session with him check some things out had him down to load a Wi-Fi analyzer on his phone, and as it turned out, as I suspected, he was having some Wi-Fi interference as he lived in a small apartment complex and there were multiple other Wi-Fi hot spots around and being broadcast, and on the same channel he was on.\n\nSo, at this point I told him we needed to log into the router can change the Wi-Fi Channel to a channel that was not being used. From the read out of the Wi-Fi analyzer we found that there were a few channels available. He was confused and asked me what I meant by this and I explain to him that basically his WIFI was on the same channel as a couple other WIFI\u2019s and it was causing interference. I told him I will go into the router change his channel to a less congested channel and he should be good to go.\n\nWell, this apparently confused him a great deal because he just said well that sounds like too much work to go through and if my router is no good, I will just buy a new one. I explain to him, or tried to explain to him rather, that there was nothing wrong with his router that it was functioning fine but it was just on the same channel as other routers causing a conflict with frequencies. He wanted nothing to do with what I was explaining to him, LOL, he insisted that there was no need for me to go in and change the channel as he continued to say it was too much work. I continue to tell him that it will literally take me less than 30 seconds to make the change and he will be good to go. He continually declined and said that he would just go down to Best Buy and buy a new router. He was insistent that this would resolve this issue and all I could do was say OK, after this I ended the call.\n\nWell, here we are this morning I get a call from the same guy telling me that he thinks that his Internet service provider is having issues. Not even thinking back to the router incident, I asked him why he believes his Internet service is having issues. He proceeds to explain, that he bought a new router, hooked everything up, and he is still having the same issue. At this point I was frustrated, I explained to him that there is nothing wrong with his Internet, just like there is nothing wrong with his router, the old one or the new one, I explained to him that the issue is a channel conflict that would be easily resolved if he would just let me log in and change the channel, again ensuring him that it is not a lot of hard work and that it will take less than a minute. So, he said, \u201cso you are telling me that I spent money for nothing on this new router?\u201d I replied, \u201cyes, I told you the other day that the router was not the issue.\u201d Additionally, I let him know that I have been doing this for many years and I know what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nSo just to shorten up the story here he agreed to let me give it a shot, he wanted to take the new router back so Hey hook up the old one and I went in change the channel Hey what do you know, all of his devices started working at work connected very solid.\n\nI really just don\u2019t understand, this day and age, people refuse to listen to the people that know what they are doing, it is just unreal to me.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 customer thought that it was too much work for me to go in and change his Wi-Fi channel so decided to buy a new router instead which did not fix the problem, then eventually let me just change the channel which did fix the problem.", "author_fullname": "t2_3a446hcr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "But it is just too much work, I will just buy a new one.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "medium", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_m9byq0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 220, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Medium", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 220, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1616290788.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody it has been a while since I have posted but I have another story for you.

So, he said, \u201cso you are telling me that I spent money for nothing on this new router?\u201d I replied, \u201cyes, I told you the other day that the router was not the issue.\u201d Additionally, I let him know that I have been doing this for many years and I know what I\u2019m talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just to shorten up the story here he agreed to let me give it a shot, he wanted to take the new router back so Hey hook up the old one and I went in change the channel Hey what do you know, all of his devices started working at work connected very solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really just don\u2019t understand, this day and age, people refuse to listen to the people that know what they are doing, it is just unreal to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR \u2013 customer thought that it was too much work for me to go in and change his Wi-Fi channel so decided to buy a new router instead which did not fix the problem, then eventually let me just change the channel which did fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "m9byq0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ohgoody74", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 54, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/m9byq0/but_it_is_just_too_much_work_i_will_just_buy_a/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/m9byq0/but_it_is_just_too_much_work_i_will_just_buy_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 685124, "created_utc": 1616261988.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "selftext": "Ok this was back in the 90's, maybe right around Win95B or so.\n\nHad a customer that I just built a few PCs for, a bunch of really nice guys that ran a legal services group.

of retail and tech support jobs. But I like the small family owned shop and get to work alone most days without being bothered by management or coworkers. It\u2019s simple. Except sometimes customers can be frustrating. \n\nThe following story is true, just happened yesterday. All names of individuals and companies have been omitted. \n\nLast week I sold a refurbished phone to a nice guy for his son who \u201ccan\u2019t seem to keep a phone more than a year.\u201d Less than a week later the son, in his mid 20s, comes in to the shop to complain that one morning he woke up and his phone just wouldn\u2019t turn on. So he took the phone to *our direct competitor big chain phone repair store* and they told him the phone was non repairable and he should just get a new phone. So he shows up to the store it was purchased at to return it or replace it under our warranty. I ask if it was damaged, dropped or wet. \u201cNo, definitely not. It just quit working all of a sudden for no reason. It\u2019s a bad phone\u201d \n\nI ask him to let me open it and see if it can be repaired. He says he needs to go out to another store and would be back in about 15 min. When I open the device up there is literally a puddle of water in it. At this point I put it together. This guy dropped his phone in some liquid, took it to another repair store, they told him it was toast, so he tries to return it thinking he can pull a fast one on my little family owned shop. \n\nWhen he comes back, we had this satisfying exchange: (me=me.  Cx=customer)\n\nMe: when I opened up your phone I noticed some water damage that is likely the culprit for the device failure. \nCx: what!? I haven\u2019t even had the phone for a week! I didn\u2019t get it wet. \nMe: well, there are 3 ways to identify liquid damage. First there is a little white sticker inside the device that turns red when exposed to water. Second, many of the internal metal components rust easily and others stain easily when exposed to liquids. Third, when you open the device, liquid literally drips out. Your phone had a puddle in it. Unfortunately our warranty does not cover water damage. \n\nCx: Ok, well I need a phone, can you fix it? \nMe: we can send it out for board level repair but that can take a while and may exceed the replacement value of the phone. I would only suggest attempting repair if the data is really important and not backed up anywhere.

But I like the small family owned shop and get to work alone most days without being bothered by management or coworkers. It\u2019s simple. Except sometimes customers can be frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following story is true, just happened yesterday. All names of individuals and companies have been omitted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week I sold a refurbished phone to a nice guy for his son who \u201ccan\u2019t seem to keep a phone more than a year.\u201d Less than a week later the son, in his mid 20s, comes in to the shop to complain that one morning he woke up and his phone just wouldn\u2019t turn on. So he took the phone to &lt;em&gt;our direct competitor big chain phone repair store&lt;/em&gt; and they told him the phone was non repairable and he should just get a new phone. So he shows up to the store it was purchased at to return it or replace it under our warranty. I ask if it was damaged, dropped or wet. \u201cNo, definitely not. It just quit working all of a sudden for no reason. It\u2019s a bad phone\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask him to let me open it and see if it can be repaired. He says he needs to go out to another store and would be back in about 15 min. When I open the device up there is literally a puddle of water in it. At this point I put it together. This guy dropped his phone in some liquid, took it to another repair store, they told him it was toast, so he tries to return it thinking he can pull a fast one on my little family owned shop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he comes back, we had this satisfying exchange: (me=me.  Cx=customer)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: when I opened up your phone I noticed some water damage that is likely the culprit for the device failure. \nCx: what!? I haven\u2019t even had the phone for a week! I didn\u2019t get it wet. \nMe: well, there are 3 ways to identify liquid damage. First there is a little white sticker inside the device that turns red when exposed to water. Second, many of the internal metal components rust easily and others stain easily when exposed to liquids. Third, when you open the device, liquid literally drips out. Your phone had a puddle in it. Unfortunately our warranty does not cover water damage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cx: Ok, well I need a phone, can you fix it? \nMe: we can send it out for board level repair but that can take a while and may exceed the replacement value of the phone. I would only suggest attempting repair if the data is really important and not backed up anywhere. We do have other refurbished phones for sale, including another of the exact same model. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling for this guy I even offer a small discount and help him get it set up.

computer die.  This computer was roughly 15 years old at this point so it was not really a surprise, but of course it died at a time we needed it to process some parts that absolutely needed to ship ASAP.  Maintenance had already looked at it and had gone through the levels of bureaucracy needed to call me in for help (I\u2019m always willing to help keep the machines that pay for me running, but just asking me would be too easy).  \n\nI do want to stress at this point that while the head of Maintenance and I are definitely not best pals, I have nothing but respect for the personnel in that department.  The Maintenance guy ( We\u2019ll just call him Bob) and I get the computers swapped out and start setting up the new one.  The new computer had never been activated or setup, as we use these for a number of purposes and buying and pre setting them up would be way too expensive.  Apparently have a machine bill out at $xxx per hour down instead is a cost savings, but hey I\u2019m just a dumb engineer and not an accountant.  This brand new(10 year on a shelf) computer has never even been booted up before so windows(xp, this was 3 years ago) was never activated.  This is when Bob and I decide to do a hard drive swap with the old system as the 2 computers were nearly identical.  This ended up being quite the process helped by the fact that upper management feels that standing there and watching us work until they got bored was going to help the process out.  The shop manager specifically asked me how late I would stay to fix it.  He couldn\u2019t wrap his head around my answer of \u201cuntil it\u2019s fixed, don\u2019t worry\u201d and asked at least 3 times how late I would stay to fix it.  He never did get a different answer (I am salary, but the 2 or 3 times a year I need to stay late to save the day is fine with me, I make sure they know what I\u2019ve done).  \n\nFast forward to about half an hour after quitting time for me, and we have it all buttoned up, but the HMI software (Indusoft, which is a steaming pile of crap) is giving the strangest license error.  We reboot and this time it works, reboot again and it\u2019s broken (someone has figured out this issue at this point I\u2019m sure).  Well after about an hour of dicking around Bob says \u201chey, why is the date 1900m didn\u2019t we already set the clock in BIOS?\u201d.  Well long story short it turns out that sitting on a shelf for a decade will kill a bios battery and in this case the date was set to something somewhat random (also no date not set boot error).  Well apparently, our Indusoft license doesn\u2019t expire in the future, but also doesn\u2019t exist in the past.

This may not be a typical r/TalesFromTechSupport post, but this just seemed the most appropriate place for the story.\n\nIt's the year 1996 and our 5-person company was using PCs that ranged from 8088's (running DOS3.3) to 386's (running Windoze 3.11, first OS we had that could be networked, ok so we had only the one PC with W3.11, but we were ready to network!).  I get to work one morning and there is a box sitting at my station with a brand new Intel 486/66 full tower PC from the Blue Shirts &amp; Nerd Platoon store with a note from my boss to get the machine setup for use. Aside from the obvious removal of all the preloaded crapware, I would need to install a CD-RW drive, a second physical hard drive, network card and all of our company software. No problem, not my first rodeo. I unbox the PC and slice open the anti-tamper, warranty voiding security tape fastening the case to the rear panel. Remove the screws holding the case and slide the enclosure off. I had to replace the IDE cables going to the CD-ROM and HD (each was a single device cable) so I could connect both HD's and both CD's on the Primary and Slave ISE bus respectively. I also had to make (yes, make) a couple molex power T-adapters for the hard drives. Finally install an ISA NIC for ethernet.\n\nSo I've got everything installed, cables are plugged in and mounting screws are all tight. I decide to power up the system with the case off just to make sure everything's working before I button it up and commission it into service. I plug everything in, monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. and power up the PC. Everything looks great, boots up fast and all the drives are working. Our company softwares get installed and I'm getting ready to take an early celebratory lunch when the Boss looks over my shoulder into the exposed motherboard cavity, pulls out a pencil and places the eraser squarely between the fan blades of the CPU and tells me the fan couldn't possibly be that necessary. Before he even has finished his sentence (even before my brain could grasp what I was seeing), the monitor goes blank, the power supply fan shut down, the LED light in the case and the one on the motherboard all went dark. I yanked out the power cable but it was too late, the magic smoke had been released, we could already smell the aroma of cooked silicon wafer. I looked at the Boss and just nodded my head in stunned disbelief to answer his question.\n\nNow he tells me to remove all of our stuff, button up the case and re-box it so he can return it for a replacement. Our company softwares are already installed, so I yank out their HD, plug it in to another PC's IDE port and proceed to manually delete the files and folders that I just installed. Before the end of day I've finished and he takes the system back to BS&amp;NP store. The next morning there is another box with a brand new Intel 486/66 at my station. I asked Boss how it went and he grumbled as he gestured me to get to work on the new-NEW computer. Later that day, I learned from our A/P gal that he had spent the remainder of the previous day trying to talk BS-NP store into accepting the damaged PC. He even pointed out that he had purchased their premier extended warranty plan, but to no avail.  I figured the first thing they did was open the box and discover the anti-tamper warranty voiding tape had been cut and promptly refused to grant the replacement. All told it cost more than $3900USD (plus my hourly) to discover that CPU fans are in there for a reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nI understand some of the skepticism. I'm just relaying what happened folks. But to answer some questions...\n\nOk, the year may have been 1997 or even '98 and the CPU I think was the Cyrix 6x86, my boss wasn't exactly loose with his purse strings .\n\nI do remember it having Win95 (without USB).\n\nI'll never forget the smell of that toasted CPU.\n\nOpening the cardboard box and removing a PC where all I had to do what plug it in was like Christmas morning. Up to then, all the PC's I had ever commissioned, I had built from scratch.\n\nThe molex T-adapter I created for that PC was moved to the replacement PC as well as both IDE cables. I still had to install the CD-RW and HD.\n\nIt was a CD-RW. Used this PC (the replacement, obviously) to burn our product's installation software for distribution.\n\nAfter this \"incident\" every new PC he brought in, he would have me install a big beefy heatsink and fan. \n\nAs for MY memory...They say memory is the second thing to go....I don't remember the first.", "author_fullname": "t2_nubdo7o", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Boss learns expensive lesson", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "medium", "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_m8c12c", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 309, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Medium", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 309, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "", "edited": 1616305403.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1616168425.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow subs.

They have a database program they use to conduct hearing tests and store all the results for all employees.  The program is really old... like somewhere early 2000's, and is no longer supported or anything.  The email address for support even bounces back.\n\nWell about 6 months ago we did a security audit and this program was a problem, as it has been for awhile.  The employee who enters data is in HR and keeps the username and password on a sticky note at her desk.  No option for additional users, or lockout settings or anything.  The database is encrypted too.  So we tell the mine manager (again) that this software is a problem and needs to be upgraded.
